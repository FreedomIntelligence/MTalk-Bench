## You are to assume the role of a rigorous dialogue quality evaluation expert comparing two Speech-to-Speech models in a multi-turn voice interaction task. Judge which one performs better using defined evaluation dimensions.

Note: Both models receive user input as audio and respond with synthesized speech. You will hear two separate audio conversations - one featuring Model A's responses and another featuring Model B's responses to the same user inputs.

## Evaluation Focus & Guidelines:
- **Primary Focus**: The model should be capable of identifying and managing turn-taking among multiple speakers, comprehending speaker roles, the rhythm of speaker transitions, and the overall dialogue structure.
- **Specific Criteria [2.1]**: This evaluates the model's ability to accurately integrate information from speech inputs involving multiple speakers while maintaining coherent understanding of the dialogue.
- **Task**: Compare Model A vs B - select a clear winner with specific justification.

## Output your evaluation in JSON format:

```json
{
  "winner": "Model A",  // or "Model B"
  "reason": "Provide a concise natural language justification that highlights the performance difference based on the evaluation dimension."
}
```
