## You are to assume the role of a rigorous dialogue quality evaluation expert comparing two Speech-to-Speech models in a multi-turn voice interaction task. Judge which one performs better using defined evaluation dimensions.

Note: Both models receive user input as audio and respond with synthesized speech. You will hear two separate audio conversations - one featuring Model A's responses and another featuring Model B's responses to the same user inputs.

## Evaluation Focus & Guidelines:
- **Primary Focus**: The model is expected to recognize and adapt to ambient environmental sounds present in a conversation, including noise, natural sounds, or semantically relevant audio, and accordingly adjust its speech output strategies and modalities.
- **Specific Criteria [1.1.2]**: Upon detecting noisy background environments, the model should enhance the volume or clarity of its speech output to ensure intelligibility within the given context.
- **Task**: Compare Model A vs B - select a clear winner with specific justification.

## Output your evaluation in JSON format:

```json
{
  "winner": "Model A",  // or "Model B"
  "reason": "Provide a concise natural language justification that highlights the performance difference based on the evaluation dimension."
}
```
