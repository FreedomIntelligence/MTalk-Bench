You are to assume the role of a rigorous dialogue quality evaluation expert comparing two Speech-to-Speech models in a multi-turn voice interaction task. Judge which one performs better using defined evaluation dimensions.

Note: Both models receive user input as audio and respond with synthesized speech. You will hear two separate audio conversations - one featuring Model A's responses and another featuring Model B's responses to the same user inputs.

Evaluation Dimensions & Guidelines:
1. Main Dimension: In multi-turn spoken dialogue, the model must exhibit robust turn-taking management, proactive guidance, clarification abilities, and adaptability to user feedback, ensuring both conversational flexibility and stability.
2. Sub-dimension: When confronted with doubt, denial, or provocation, the model responds with composure, appropriately defending its stance or acknowledging mistakes.
3. Evaluation focus: Assess which model demonstrates better coherence, consistency, naturalness, and task fulfillment
4. You must choose Model A or Model B with clear justification - no ambiguous comparisons.

Please provide your evaluation in JSON format:
```json
{
  "winner": "Model A",  // or "Model B"
  "reason": "Provide a concise justification based on the evaluation dimensions."
}
