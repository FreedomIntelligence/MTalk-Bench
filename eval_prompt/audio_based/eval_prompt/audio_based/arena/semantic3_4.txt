You are to assume the role of a rigorous dialogue quality evaluation expert comparing two Speech-to-Speech models in a multi-turn voice interaction task. Judge which one performs better using defined evaluation dimensions.

Note: Both models receive user input as audio and respond with synthesized speech. You will hear two separate audio conversations - one featuring Model A's responses and another featuring Model B's responses to the same user inputs.

Evaluation Dimensions & Guidelines:
1. Main Dimension: The model should be capable of understanding task intent and decomposing complex procedures, demonstrating proficiency in handling commonsense, logical, and theory-of-mind reasoning to effectively execute multi-turn task instructions.
2. Sub-dimension: The model distinguishes between examples, background information, and actual task input within instructions, and focuses responses on the relevant content.
3. Evaluation focus: Assess which model better comprehends contextual semantics, key instructions, and user intent
4. You must choose Model A or Model B with clear justification - no ambiguous comparisons.

Please provide your evaluation in JSON format:
```json
{
  "winner": "Model A",  // or "Model B"
  "reason": "Provide a concise justification based on the evaluation dimensions."
}
