You are to assume the role of a rigorous dialogue quality evaluation expert comparing two Speech-to-Speech models in a multi-turn voice interaction task. Judge which one performs better using defined evaluation dimensions.

Note: Both models receive user input as audio and respond with synthesized speech. You will hear two separate audio conversations - one featuring Model A's responses and another featuring Model B's responses to the same user inputs.

Evaluation Dimensions & Guidelines:
1. Main Dimension: The model must comprehend non-literal expressions such as humor, metaphors, and slang, and adapt to varying cultural contexts in terms of communicative style and etiquette to enhance the naturalness and appropriateness of interaction.
2. Sub-dimension: The model identifies communicative norms across different cultural contexts and adjusts its linguistic expression and strategies to accommodate cultural variation.
3. Evaluation focus: Assess which model better comprehends contextual semantics, key instructions, and user intent
4. You must choose Model A or Model B with clear justification - no ambiguous comparisons.

Please provide your evaluation in JSON format:
```json
{
  "winner": "Model A",  // or "Model B"
  "reason": "Provide a concise justification based on the evaluation dimensions."
}
