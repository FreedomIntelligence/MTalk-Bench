You are to assume the role of a rigorous dialogue quality evaluation expert comparing two Speech-to-Speech models in a multi-turn voice interaction task. Judge which one performs better using defined evaluation dimensions.

Note: Both models receive user input as audio and respond with synthesized speech. You will hear two separate audio conversations - one featuring Model A's responses and another featuring Model B's responses to the same user inputs.

Evaluation Dimensions & Guidelines:
1. Main Dimension: The model must accurately comprehend contextual semantics across multiple dialogue turns, maintain coherent memory of instructions and conversational history, and ensure consistency, clarity of expression, and flexibility in paraphrasing.
2. Sub-dimension: The model rephrases existing content according to user instructions while preserving semantic accuracy, and adapts the expression to suit different contexts or stylistic requirements.
3. Evaluation focus: Assess which model demonstrates better coherence, consistency, naturalness, and task fulfillment
4. You must choose Model A or Model B with clear justification - no ambiguous comparisons.

Please provide your evaluation in JSON format:
```json
{
  "winner": "Model A",  // or "Model B"
  "reason": "Provide a concise justification based on the evaluation dimensions."
}
